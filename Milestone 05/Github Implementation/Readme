*Project Description*

Out of fifteen sustainable goals as a group we focused on eighth goal named Decent growth and Economic growth to continue with our project. This goal enhances the Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. With that enhancement we select this topic to develop the new product to the society to fulfill their needs. 
Through the research we found out that the small-scale tea landowners face so many troubles when handing over the tea to the factory and tracking the income. In the normal process the tea leaves to be collected by the tea factory in the area. In this collecting process we found that the tea factory also faces problems. As a solution to this problem, we have decided to launch a mobile application.
This project also fulfills the goals under sustainable goal eight. Through this solution some more job opportunities will be created such as the system admins for the system. The employees of the factory get an easier way to keep their data saved. This also helps to uplift the employees with modern technology.
